                    <p class="text-center">Pay only for the user that clicks on your advertisements. This is way better than traditional marketing, providing a more targeted audience overall. In addition, PPC strategies like Search Engine Advertisements (SEA) give your brand prominence in the SERPs while your SEO and inbound tactics work their magic. This helps gain brand awareness and increase brand trust by appearing in earlier search results. These are especially important for SEA, as it ultimately determines how high the advertising costs are. We provide our clients access to Google analytics so they can follow along and track their progress.</p>
